- How to represent constants in capability inputs?
- Should each part of pipeline compute nodes be represented, or just represented uniformly?
- How should the compute node selection algorithm function?
- Should capabilities include load/store instructions, or should capabilities only include DFG-like nodes (e.g., arithmetic operations)
